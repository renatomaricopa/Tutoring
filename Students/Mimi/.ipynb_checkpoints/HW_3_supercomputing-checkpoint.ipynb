    "1. Create a program that ties together all the concepts we've used so far: functions, loops, conditionals with Booleans, and list manipulation. \n",

    "__Context:__ A supercomputer is a bunch of individual computers linked together so they can talk to each other, send data back and forth quickly, and perform calculations in parallel (in parallel means that each computer is working on its own part of the problem simultaneously). Each individual computer that is part of a supercomputer is called a \"node\". Programs that run on supercomputers are called \"massively parallel programs\" because they are executed on multiple nodes at the same time. The nodes share information with each other as the program runs in order to perform their calculations. Typically, the more nodes you use to solve a problem, the faster it runs and therefore the bigger the problem you can solve may be! \n",
    "\n",
    "Supercomputers are managed by a central authority (e.g. Summit, the US's current fastest supercomputer, is managed by the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Lab) and shared among users. Jobs (codes that need to be run) are submitted using a queue system. The queue system is automatic and distributes computing resources as they become available to jobs waiting in the queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, automatic queue managers have maximum runtimes that you can request for a single job on a supercomputer. You don't want some user hogging the system for days and days! So, for instance on Summit, if you'd like to run your job on 60 nodes, the maximum runtime you can request in the queue is 360 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Task:__\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of a team of reserachers who want to run a simulation on a supercomputer to study the  nature of dark energy. You expect that your code will run for a long time, maybe several days, but the maximum runtime permitted for a job request on this supercomputer is only a few hours. That means that every couple hours, your program wil need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) detect that it's almost at its maximum runtime, and \n",
    "\n",
    "2) save its progress before exiting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to implement this so that your group can run their simulation successfully! \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that detects how long it has been running and, after a specified length of time has passed, triggers a special action. In reality, that special action would be saving the progress of the simulation. For testing, though, just have the program print out a message like \"We are running out of time in the job! Saving progress and exiting.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "__Hint:__ you will need to do some independent investigation to find a way to detect the current time in Python. Google to the rescue! \n",
    "\n",
    "__Hint:__ you will need to use some kind of loop and a conditional statement to check if you're approaching maximum runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hint:__ for testing, we'll set our maximum runtime to something reasonable, like a few seconds! 360 minutes is an awfully long time to wait to see if your program ran correctly!\n",

    "__Optional Challenge Problem__: Sometimes, we don't know ahead of time which step numbers are risky and need a backup beforehand. Instead, if we're simulating the dynamics of dark energy and dark matter in a cosmological N-body simulation, here's what we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every step has an associated time (we're pressing 'play' on the formation of the Universe). Time, for some neat reasons I'd be happy to tell you more about if you're curious, can be described using redshift in cosmology. In a nutshell, the reason for this is that our Universe is expanding faster and faster, so any light that's emitted from an astronomical object gets stretched (red-shifted) by the spacetime expansion. By the time it arrives at Earth and we observe it, its wavelength is different from the wavelength it had when it was emitted. And the longer it's been traveling through the expanding spacetime (the older the light is), the more it's been redshifted. \n",

    "Your simulation code will do a risky procedure at every redshift in RISKY_REDSHIFTS. Your job is to figure out in real time whether the step your simulation is currently executing is the timestep immediately preceding a timestep corresponding to a redshift in RISKY_REDSHIFTS, and perform a backup if this is the case. \n",
